**Playwright Test Result Browser Extension**  
This Chrome extension displays Playwright test results directly on the browser icon. It reads a locally stored JSON file or fetches results from GitHub, showing the number of passed and failed tests in real time. The extension also detects new test runs, updates automatically, and provides notifications when new results are available—making it easy to monitor test outcomes at a glance.
